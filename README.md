# hs2048

A simple 2048 game written in Haskell.

## How to play
* `nix run` to run immediately, `nix build` to compile the binary which will appear in `./result/bin/hs2048`

* WASD to move. Q to quit.  
* CLI arguments if the binary is run directly:  
-h for help  
-p for port to run with TCP server for remote control.
